Multicompartmental models of the Inferior Olive of the mouse, with reconstructions from [1]. 

Models and morphologies have been encoded in [neuroML](github.com/NeuroML/) and can run in [Opensourcebrain](opensourcebrain.org). 

In addition to ion channel models, the cells possess simple calcium models and Q10 temperature parameters.
